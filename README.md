Analyzing website data from Quality Alloys 

QA is a US-based distributor of different grades of a variety of alloys used in industrial manufacturing.

QA markets its products through direct mail, advertising in trade magazines, and, more recently, via paid listings on two industrial product web portals, GlobalSpec and ThomasNet.In mid-2008, QA decided to extend its marketing reach by establishing a company web presence. The goals of the companyâ€™s website were to (a) drive new sales, (b) make product and contact information available, and (c) give or add legitimacy to its brand. 

My team was tasked to use the tools at hand analyzing the web traffic, and company's sales figures provide. 
We were also asked to provide valuable insights into the website performance and its effect on attracting new customers as well as increasing revenues.
